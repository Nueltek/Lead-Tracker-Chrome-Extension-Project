Day 42 of #100DaysOfCode - I finished a simple Chrome extension project from the Scrimba course.
The extension is called Lead Tracker, and its function is to save tabs. Users can track leads by either automatically clicking the "Save Tab" button or manually inputting the URL.
It utilizes the localStorage mechanism to store this data, so even if the browser is cleared or closed, the data persists.
Some of the key concepts covered in this section include DOM manipulation, looping (for iterating through the inputs to render them to the DOM), event listeners, the JSON object, and more. Now, I'm moving on to the solo project, which involves creating a simple unit converter.
